      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple little project I have set myself because in recent
        months I have not been producing a lot of new artwork for various
        reasons, and if I am honest I have neglected my drawing for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        So born out of an interest in birds I have set about working on a simple
        drawing/painting of a bird each week of the year. I am hoping that
        consistently working with similar subjects I will actually get to the
        heart of subjects and the quality's I want to focus on as well as slowly
        improving and experimenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I anticipate the quality to fluctuate drastically as I go and to a
        degree part of what I want to do is see how simple I can go while still
        including everything that is needed so hopefully looking back on it all
        as a body of work will be an interesting experience.
